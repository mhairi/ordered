\title{Order by the numbers in a factor.}
\usage{
order_by_number(factor, desc = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{factor}{The factor you want to order}

\item{desc}{Set to TRUE to order descending.}
}
\value{
an ordered factor
}
\description{
Order the factor by the numbers used in the factor. This function
orders on symbolic numbers: 1, 2, 3 etc.
}
\details{
Numbers present in the factor levels will be extracted and
used to order the factor. If more than one continuous number is
present in the factor level then the first number will be used for
numbering.

Ties between two different factor levels are ordered arbitrarily.

Factor levels without numbers are ordered lowest arbitrarily.

\examples{
f <- c('group_1', 'group_2', 'group_3')
order_by_number(f)

factor <- c('a_3', 'a_3', 'a_1', 'a', 'b')
order_by_number(factor)
