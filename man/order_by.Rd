\title{Order a factor by the levels of another variable.}
\usage{
order_by(factor, order, desc = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{factor}{A factor or character vector.}

\item{order}{A numeric variable (or coercible  to numeric).}

\item{desc}{Set to TRUE to order descending.}
}
\value{
An ordered factor.
}
\description{
The factor and the order must be of the same length
and each value of factor must correspond with one
value of order.
}
\details{
This is useful when you have unique values of factor
and numeric, but can be useful in other circumstances
when another variable corresponds to the ordering of the
factor.

Ties are arbitrarily ordered for unique factors.
}
\examples{
# Ordering a factor where the values are unique
order_by(letters[1:3], 1:3)

# Ordering a factor by a variable that provides the levels
order_by(c('a', 'a', 'b'), c(1, 1, 2))
